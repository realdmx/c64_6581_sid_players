# c64_sid_players

Original and reverse-engineered SID 6581 / 8580 music players.

The SID 6581 / 8580 are mysterious beasts.

Back in the day, every musician worth their salt would program their own music routine / player.

The widely varying understanding of 6502 and the 6581 / 8580 in combination with the artistic mind of the author, would yield a certain "sound" and style.

My aim is to make the assembly produce a .sid file which can be played with any modern SID player.

I've decided to publish these sources to be compatible with the ACME assembler, for no other reason than that's what I'm most familiar with.

But initially, some sourcecode might not be compatible with anything, until they're cleaned up.

Feel free to pull request.
