# c64_sid_players

Original and reverse-engineered SID 6581 music players.

The SID 6581 is a mysterious beast.

Back in the day, every musician worth their salt would program their own music routine / player.

The widely varying understanding of 6502 and the 6581, combined with the artistic mind of the author, would create a certain "sound".

I've decided to publish these sources to be compatible with the ACME assembler, for no other reason than that's what I'm most familiar with.

My aim is to make the assembly produce a .sid file which can be played with any modern SID player.

But initially, some sourcecode might not be compatible with anything, until they're cleaned up.

Feel free to pull request.
